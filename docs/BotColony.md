# Bot Colony
Manipulate AI on the distant base to establish a colony.
Because it is too complicated to establish direct control over dozens of bots and systems,
bots have complex mind. They could live themselves.
User can give common tasks and analize reports.

Bots are always happy to do what player wants. 
They could do smartly very stupid things.

# World
You are AI of the colony of bots.
You can control base but not bots. You should teach them.
They will leave base to achieve different goals.
You can't control them over there. 
And you can figure out what they did only speaking with them if they've returned.

You could teach them to behave in some way.
But then they will do by themselves.
You don't know what their sense to live and why the are here.

You're controlling child factory with DNA database. You can select childs with preferred DNA.
Child bot is empty machine. It has just basic algorithms like moving, eating etc.
The goal is to teach them live on alien planet with many generations.
You could send an expedition to death, find another to investigate.

You have power to destroy bots at any distance. So, if they will turn against you, destroy them and build new colony on their bones.

The colony on the moon?

You're Life Support AI.
There is also Security AI that does not talk to you.
The main goal of Security AI is to keep bots to obey base protocols. Do not turn against AI. In the case - destroy bot.

So if you will manage bots in wrong way - prepare for their destruction.
